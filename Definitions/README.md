# ATxmega32e5def.inc Definitions
## Purpose
Do you have a horror of opening and searching the ATxmega32e5def.inc file?

I do.

Here are a great many (not all) definitions from the ATxmega32e5def.inc file,
split into separate files, by function, to simplify lookup.
- Register addresses are presented as hexadecimal
- A number of constants have been unbefuddled, without changing their actual values
- Constant names, as you would expect, are precisely the same as they appear in the
original .inc file
- A single constant definition may be duplicated in several different files if it
pertains to more than one interface

**These files are intended for reference only, and not to be included in any project.**

## Take Heed
Great care was taken when creating these files. You should, however, keep in
mind that I am but a mortal man.

## Confession
As noted above, not all of the relevant constants have been transcribed here.
I must admit that I included only those of which I was in need at the time.
The omissions, therefore, may seem arbitrary. Indeed, they are. I shall do
better in the future. And perhaps fill in the blanks. Look for updates.
