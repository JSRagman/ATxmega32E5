# ATxmega32e5def.inc Definitions
## Purpose
Do you have a horror of opening and searching the ATxmega32e5def.inc file?

I do.

Here are a great many (not all) definitions from the ATxmega32e5def.inc file,
split into separate files, by function, to simplify lookup.
- Register addresses are presented as hexadecimal
- A number of constants have been unbefuddled, without changing their actual values
- Constant names, as you would expect, are precisely the same as they appear in the
original .inc file
- A single constant definition may be duplicated in several different files if it
pertains to more than one interface

**These files are intended for reference only, and not to be included in any project.**

## Illumination
My intention, initially, was only to transcribe definitions into separate files so
that the act of looking up a constant name would be easy (easier, anyway).

But then I started correcting comments that were inconsistent, muddled, or, according to the
datasheet, just plain wrong. As a result, some sections are heavily commented and many
comments diverge markedly from the original .inf file.

I would like you to keep two things in mind:
1. I have not altered any constant values, only the comments that surround them, and
2. Said alterations were to bring comments into line with the datasheet - not as a result of operational testing, and
3. The datasheet itself was muddled more often than I would have guessed, and
4. Additional clarity was needed, and
5. There are never just two things.

## Confession
As noted above, not all of the relevant constants have been transcribed here.
I must admit that I included only those of which I was in need at the time.
The omissions, therefore, may seem arbitrary. Indeed, they are. I shall do
better in the future. And perhaps fill in the blanks. Look for updates.

## Take Heed
Great care was taken when creating these files. You should, however, keep in
mind that I am but a mortal man.
