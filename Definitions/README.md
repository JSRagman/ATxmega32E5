# ATxmega32e5def.inc Definitions
## Purpose
Do you have a horror of opening and searching the ATxmega32e5def.inc file?

Here are a great many (not all) definitions from the ATxmega32e5def.inc file,
split into separate files, by function, to simplify lookup.

Register addresses are presented as hexadecimal. A number of constants have
been unbefuddled, without changing their actual values.

These are intended for reference only, and not to be included in any project.

## Take Heed
Great care was taken when creating these files. You should, however, keep in
mind that I am but a mortal man.
